# Language-Translator
Language Translator in Python, with GUI developed in PyQt5 using Microsoft Translation API.

Implemented a system that allows two people who speak two different languages to use one application to communicate about getting directions to locations in Gainesville. This application includes:
a. Microsoft Translate API (https://docs.microsoft.com/en‐us/azure/cognitiveservices/translator/) to do the language selection and translation. 
b. Have a “complete interaction” button that, when clicked, moves the user to a page in Qualtrics (http://ufl.qualtrics.com) where they will answer the a few survey questions.

This was implemented for the course Human-Computer Interaction.
